# flowroot for ForgeFlow
## Start by writing your thought and ideas , in unstructured way, create a bullet point of everything that comes up to your mind
### I need to decide about structure of this fucking self-reffering repo

- is having a repo for this even a good Idea?
- What do I want to be in the final file?
  - just the what? the why? the how? 
  - discussions? thought provocative questions? questions to cover important aspects of that file?
- should I have the placement, reasons, rational, best practices of product_analysis all in itself?
  - what about How I decide what should be in it? 


- I think I got somewhere: Lets actually use there repo for creation ForgeFlow


### motivation and rationale 
 If you already know what exactly you want to build, you technically are one step ahead of here:  
You have the product definition, and from that you could start creating/developing! Happy  
developing! But I beleive its not enough! Having the what, without having understanding of the why,  
only works if everything goes according to plan, specially, the plan should go acording to the plan!  
We all know that's not happening, at least not where we live, in the the real world. 


## General Workflow for Python Projects
1. Project Definition
Objective: Define the purpose and scope of the project.
Example for "Data Extraction": Extract and store price-related data from online sources in a structured local database.
Key Questions:
What is the problem being solved?
What are the expected outcomes or deliverables?
2. Requirements Gathering
Functional Requirements:
Define specific tasks the project will perform.
Example: Support Telegram channel scraping, handle multiple data formats, etc.
Non-Functional Requirements:
Scalability, performance, maintainability, and usability considerations.
Data Requirements:
Data sources, expected input, and output format.
Example: Input: Telegram messages; Output: Database records.
3. Use Case and Feature Analysis
Identify primary use cases and key features.
Use Case 1: Extract messages from Telegram channels.
Use Case 2: Save data into a structured database with metadata.
Prioritize and document all features.
4. High-Level Architecture Design
Core Components:
Define the main modules and their responsibilities.
Example for "Data Extraction":
Data Collector: Handles scraping or API integration.
Data Processor: Cleans and transforms data.
Data Storage: Handles database operations.
Workflow Diagram:
Create a flowchart or diagram showing interactions between components.
Technology Stack:
List programming languages, libraries, and tools.
Example: Python, SQLite/PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Telethon.
5. Detailed Design
Modules and Submodules:
Break down components into smaller, manageable parts.
Example: data_collector.telegram, data_processor.cleaning, etc.
Data Models:
Define database schema and any in-memory structures.
Example: Message table with fields: ID, text, timestamp, sender, etc.
API Interfaces:
Define how components interact via APIs or functions.

## Workflow Summary
Step	Document	Purpose
1. Analyze	product_analysis.md	Explore and analyze the product's needs.
2. Define	product_definition.md	Finalize the product’s vision and features.
3. Design Decisions	design_decision.md	Record technical choices and rationale.
4. Architecture	architecture.md	Describe the system’s structure and design.
5. Database Design	database_design.md	Focus on database schema and interactions.
6. User Documentation	README.md / user_guide.md	Document usage from a user perspective.


# flowroot template (`docs/flowroot.md`)
## Start by writing your thought and ideas , in unstructured way, create a bullet point of everything that comes up to your mind
## Purpose of flowroot
This document captures the initial unstructured thoughts, ideas, and observations about the project.  
It serves as the **starting point**, respecting the natural flow of ideas without forcing   
categorization or structure.   
The focus is on high-level or critical or impactful aspects of the   
project.



### Why This Step Matters
- **Respect Natural Order**: Let ideas emerge organically without interruption.
- **Avoid Overthinking**: This is a space to brainstorm freely—perfectionism can come later.
- **Prioritize High-Level Thoughts**:
  - General, abstract, and critical ideas take precedence.
  - Mention details only if they are critical to the project’s foundation.
- **Maximize Impact**: Focus on points where importance × level of abstraction is high.

---

## Guidelines for Use
- **Write Freely**: Use bullet points to jot down anything that comes to mind.
- **Date Entries**: Add timestamps to track the progression of your thoughts.
- **Highlight Key Ideas**: Use tags (`#critical`, `#abstract`) or formatting to mark essential points.

---

## Initial Thoughts

### [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Briefly describe the core idea or feature.
- Highlight any specific challenges, goals, or inspirations.
- [Optional] Add clarifying points or related questions.

---

### [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Add another set of thoughts here.

---

## Next Steps
- **Categorize and Refine**: Review this document periodically and move structured ideas into appropriate files.
- **Identify Patterns**: Look for recurring themes or critical points that may inform the next steps.
