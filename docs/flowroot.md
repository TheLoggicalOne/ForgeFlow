# flowroot for ForgeFlow
## Start by writing your thought and ideas , in unstructured way, create a bullet point of everything that comes up to your mind
### I need to decide about structure of this fucking self-reffering repo

- is having a repo for this even a good Idea?
- What do I want to be in the final file?
  - just the what? the why? the how? 
  - discussions? thought provocative questions? questions to cover important aspects of that file?
- should I have the placement, reasons, rational, best practices of product_analysis all in itself?
  - what about How I decide what should be in it? 


- I think I got somewhere: Lets actually use there repo for creation ForgeFlow


### motivation and rationale 
 If you already know what exactly you want to build, you technically are one step ahead of here:  
You have the product definition, and from that you could start creating/developing! Happy  
developing! But I beleive its not enough! Having the what, without having understanding of the why,  
only works if everything goes according to plan, specially, the plan should go acording to the plan!  
We all know that's not happening, at least not where we live, in the the real world. 


# flowroot template
## Start by writing your thought and ideas , in unstructured way, create a bullet point of everything that comes up to your mind
## Purpose of flowroot
This document captures the initial unstructured thoughts, ideas, and observations about the project.  
It serves as the **starting point**, respecting the natural flow of ideas without forcing   
categorization or structure.   
The focus is on high-level or critical or impactful aspects of the   
project.



### Why This Step Matters
- **Respect Natural Order**: Let ideas emerge organically without interruption.
- **Avoid Overthinking**: This is a space to brainstorm freely—perfectionism can come later.
- **Prioritize High-Level Thoughts**:
  - General, abstract, and critical ideas take precedence.
  - Mention details only if they are critical to the project’s foundation.
- **Maximize Impact**: Focus on points where importance × level of abstraction is high.

## Guidelines for Use
- **Write Freely**: Use bullet points to jot down anything that comes to mind.
- **Date Entries**: Add timestamps to track the progression of your thoughts.
- **Highlight Key Ideas**: Use tags (`#critical`, `#abstract`) or formatting to mark essential points.

---

## Initial Thoughts

### [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Briefly describe the core idea or feature.
- Highlight any specific challenges, goals, or inspirations.

### [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Next Steps
- **Categorize and Refine**: Review this document periodically and move structured ideas into appropriate files.
- **Identify Patterns**: Look for recurring themes or critical points that may inform the next steps.
