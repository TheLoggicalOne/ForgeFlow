# Flow

This document captures the initial unstructured thoughts, ideas, and observations about the project.  
It serves as the **starting point**, respecting the natural flow of ideas without forcing   
categorization or structure.   
The focus is on high-level or critical or impactful aspects of the   
project.

## Why This Step Matters
- **Respect Natural Order**: Let ideas emerge organically without interruption.
- **Avoid Overthinking**: This is a space to brainstorm freely—perfectionism can come later.
- **Prioritize High-Level Thoughts**:
  - General, abstract, and critical ideas take precedence.
  - Mention details only if they are critical to the project’s foundation.
- **Maximize Impact**: Focus on points where importance × level of abstraction is high.

---

## Guidelines for Use
- **Write Freely**: Use bullet points to jot down anything that comes to mind.
- **Date Entries**: Add timestamps to track the progression of your thoughts.
- **Highlight Key Ideas**: Use tags (`#critical`, `#abstract`) or formatting to mark essential points.
