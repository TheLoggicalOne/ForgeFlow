# ForgeFlow
- What is this? A general workflow for creation, specifically creation of software products.
- How to use it? clone the repository and start useing it.
- Why should you use this? 
## 
If you already know what exactly you want to build, you technically are one step ahead of here:  
You have the product definition, and from that you could start creating/developing! Happy  
developing! But I beleive its not enough! Having the what, without having understanding of the why,  
only works if everything goes according to plan, specially, the plan should go acording to the plan!  
We all know that's not happening, at least not where we live, in the the real world. 

## Key Directories and Files:
- **src/**: Contains the source code of your Python package or program.
- **tests/**: Includes unit tests and other test-related files.
- **docs/**: Contains structured documentation files based on the workflow.
- **README.md**: Provides a high-level overview of the project for users.
- **setup.py** / **pyproject.toml**: Handles packaging and dependencies.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies for the project.
## How to Use This Template
1. **Clone this repository.**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd ForgeFlow
   ```
2. **Rename `your_package_name` in the `src` directory** to your actual package name.
3. **Update documentation files** in the `docs` directory as you progress through the workflow.
4. **Follow the structured workflow**:
   - Start with `product_analysis.md`.
   - Move to `product_definition.md`.
   - Document decisions in `design_decisions.md`.
   - Finalize the system in `architecture.md`.
   - Add database-specific details in `database_design.md`.
5. **Iterate and expand** based on your project’s needs.
