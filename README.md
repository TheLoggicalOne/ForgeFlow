The general workflow for creation, specifically software products
## Key Directories and Files:
- **src/**: Contains the source code of your Python package or program.
- **tests/**: Includes unit tests and other test-related files.
- **docs/**: Contains structured documentation files based on the workflow.
- **README.md**: Provides a high-level overview of the project for users.
- **setup.py** / **pyproject.toml**: Handles packaging and dependencies.

## How to Use This Template
1. **Clone this repository.**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd ForgeFlow
   ```
2. **Rename `your_package_name` in the `src` directory** to your actual package name.
3. **Update documentation files** in the `docs` directory as you progress through the workflow.
4. **Follow the structured workflow**:
   - Start with `product_analysis.md`.
   - Move to `product_definition.md`.
   - Document decisions in `design_decisions.md`.
   - Finalize the system in `architecture.md`.
   - Add database-specific details in `database_design.md`.
5. **Iterate and expand** based on your projectâ€™s needs.
